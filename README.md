## CS 496: Special Topics in Data Systems Seminar (Fall 2022)
* **Instructor:** [Andrew Crotty](https://cs.brown.edu/people/acrotty/)
* **Day/Time:** TuTh 2:00-3:20pm
* **Location:** [Tech A110](https://www.northwestern.edu/fm/campus/classroom-catalog/tech-a110.html)

### Description
This is a seminar course that will explore the design and implementation of
key-value storage engines, which have become ubiquitous in a wide variety of
modern data management applications. It is intended for graduate and advanced
undergraduate students interested in systems research. Students will learn how
to: (1) read and critically evaluate systems research papers; (2) craft
presentations that distill and convey core research ideas; and (3) plan and
execute a final project that answers an interesting systems research question.

### Grading
Since this is a seminar course, it will not include exams or traditional
homework assignments. Instead, students will spend most of their time reading,
presenting, and discussing research papers. They will also complete a final
project of their choosing. Grades will be determined based on the following
criteria:

##### Paper Presentations – 25%
Each class, one student will present and lead the discussion for the
assigned research paper. Presentations should be about 30 minutes long and cover
the high-level ideas of the work, key technical details, experimental results,
and any relevant background or related work. They should additionally include
3-5 explicit discussion questions for the class, either interspersed throughout
the talk or at the end. Presenters are especially encouraged to point out any
shortcomings of the paper and stimulate discussion about areas for improvement.
Presentation slots are shown in the [Schedule](#schedule) and will be determined
on a first-come, first-served basis.

##### Reading Reviews + Discussion Participation – 20%
All students not presenting a given paper must prepare a short write-up that
will be similar to a review from a systems conference. Write-ups are due prior
to the start of each class and should include the following content:

* An overview of the main idea(s) proposed and summary of the contributions (1 solid paragraph)
* Three (or more) strong points about the paper (1-2 sentences each)
* Three (or more) weak points about the paper (1-2 sentences each)

##### Lightning Talks – 5%
Each class, one student will present a 5-10 minute overview of **any** topic
related to data management (including presentations of their own research).

* **Waterloo Data Systems Group:** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEdu5yMr3Vry91tFjopWv6g/videos

##### Final Project – 50%
Students may work individually or in groups of 2-3 to complete a final project
of their choosing on an approved topic related to the course content. The
project materials should include:

* Project proposal (5-10 minutes, modeled after a short conference talk)
* Project presentation (20-30 minutes, modeled after a full conference talk)
* Written report (at least 6 pages excluding references, modeled after a conference paper)
* Programming component (code, benchmarks, demo, etc.)

### Additional Information
Please see below for additional course policies and information.

##### Plagiarism
Plagiarism will not be tolerated. All writing (e.g., paper write-ups, final
project report) must be your own. You may not copy (including minor rewording)
directly from papers, outside sources, or other students. You are free to borrow
from publicly available presentation materials (e.g., slides, images) and code
with proper attribution, but what you produce should not simply be a facsimile
of someone else's work. If at all in doubt about whether something is
acceptable, please reach out to ask for clarification. See Northwestern's
policies on Academic Integrity for additional information:
https://www.northwestern.edu/provost/policies-procedures/academic-integrity/

##### Late Policy
This course has no formal provisions for late submission. Paper write-ups are
due prior to the start of class on the day of the scheduled presentation. All
other dates (e.g., presentations, final project deadlines) are firm. Extreme
circumstances (e.g., medical emergencies) will be accommodated with accompanying
written documentation (e.g., a doctor's note).

##### Accommodations
Northwestern is committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment
for everyone. Please reach out if you have a disability or other condition that
requires special accommodations. See the AccessibleNU website for more
information: https://www.northwestern.edu/accessiblenu/

##### Mental Health
Being a student can be stressful. If you feel that you are under too much
pressure or other issues are affecting your academic performance, please reach
out to Northwestern's Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers
confidential counseling and can provide documentation for late policy
accommodations. See the CAPS website for more information:
